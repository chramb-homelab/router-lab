# Router Lab
This lab was created to help me configure and test my homelab router configuration.

I opted for [terraform](https://terraform.io/) based lab because it would be easy to create and destroy. My hypervisor of choice was [libvirt](https://libvirt.org) with [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org)/[KVM](https://linux-kvm.org) backend. 

Terraform provider used: [dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dmacvicar/libvirt/latest/docs) [GitHub](https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt)
